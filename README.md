# PokerLabSample
Simple project for building my eventual semester online poker project, prompts user for a username before continuing with the game, then the user can add a bet amount with its poker chips being displaced, and then finally the user can draw random poker cards. No 'game yet' but this is useful in creating my eventual poker game.
